# Education Valley ðŸ“•

## What is it about?

### Education Valley is a simple app, in which you decide what's the minimum and maximum value to train your multiplication skills. It's a project of day 35, from [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), by [Paul Hudson](https://twitter.com/twostraws), to better stick with contents taught on projects 4, 5 and 6.
